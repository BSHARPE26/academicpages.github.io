Currently undergoing a PhD research studentship with the University of Chichester, in collaboration with King’s College London, to conduct a series of studies examining the attributes that underpin lifeguard expertise and hazard detection performance. This project is also ran in collaboration with Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).

I’m also an Associate Lecturer within the Institute of Education, Health, and Social Sciences (Department of Psychology and Counselling) and the Institute of Sport at the University of Chichester. Within the Department of Psychology, I lead module seminars on; Cognitive Psychology, Biological Psychology and Abnormal and Forensic Psychology. Whilst I lead, have led, modules within the Institute of Sport on; Applications of Psychology in Sport and Exercise (Skill Acquisition), Cognitive Psychology in Sport and Motivating Athletes. In conjunction with his teaching responsibilities, I’ve worked towards and gained the Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy accreditation.

I’m also the Universities Psychology Lab Technician within Institute of Sport and the Institute of Education, Health and Social Sciences. Here, I support and contribute to the overall functioning of the Psychology Lab. The role includes providing specialist technical support to staff and students undertaking detailed scientific testing, demonstrating support and delivery of specialist equipment, and actively participating in the implementation of the Universities recruitment strategy.

My PhD Research

My PhD research with the University of Chichester, in collaboration with King’s College London, is conducting a series of studies examining the attributes that underpin lifeguard expertise and hazard detection performance. Through working alongside the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), the project aims to further research in drown prevention and highlight a means to reduce the likelihood of a drown scenario unfolding in our lifeguarded waters. It is envisaged that once the offline attributes that determine expertise are identified, an fMRI study will be conducted to examine brain volume, brain function (volume of oxygen being used at specific sites) and brain pathway connectivity (water diffusion) differences between experienced lifeguards and a group of matched controls. Take part in the initial study found here.
